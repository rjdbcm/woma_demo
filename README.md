# Woma Programming Language Demo/Template

Here is everything that is needed to build a small CPython extension in the Woma Programming Language.
The only requirement is to install the compiler Aspidites.

You can build it with the included setup script by running:
```shell
./setup_demo.py
```

To run the demo use:
```shell
python -m src.demo
```
